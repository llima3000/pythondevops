Folow this step inside the docker container avaliable. Carl has this controller.

Tu run the converion you will need all files on same directory:
    - VIP_Master_List.csv -> csv file generated from a spreadh List provided from Chris with 
        all virtual services and their properties
    - irules_conv.yml - list matching irules to specific Avi config
    - bigip.conf -> f5 bigip.conf config file
    - changeip.py -> script to change the IP address and virtual service name acordingly the 
        VIP_Master_List.csv
    - parsing_yaml.py -> script to change the SE group and seting the use vip as SNAT option, 
        can also set a new cloud connector
    - run-playbook.sh -> This script will ask the controller IP admin username and password 
        then will run the ansible playbook using this parameters


Steps: 
1 - First tun the the following script. The output will be a file called f5output.cfg, this is the bigip.conf with all ip address and vs names founded changed acordignly
./changeip.py 

2 - Run the script to get the correct list of virtual services per controller/avicontroller
./list_vs.py avicontroller

2 - Run the f5_converter with the following command
f5_converter.py -f f5output.cfg --controller_version 17.2.10 --ansible --cloud_name na01 --custom_config irules_conv.yml --vs_filter <list>

3 - Run the following script to adjust the SE group and use vip as source nat. The result will be the a file called baml_avi_playbook.yml
./parsing_yaml.py

4 - Run the command and answer the questions about the controller username and password:
./run-playbook.sh 







ip address ending 285 - wrong ip address

17.2.10-3p2 - When VIP to SNAT detach reatach
17.2.10-3p3 - ICMP issue
17.2.10-3p4 - DNS with UDP fastpath preserv IP


Hy @here, I’m needing some help about patch info to send to the user. Let’s go to my questions:

1 - Client has 3 fix to apply: 17.2.10-3p2, 17.2.10-3p3 and 17.2.10-3p4, as I was informed I just need apply the last one, right?
2 - How can I check if the client has access to all this patches through the portal?
3 - I saw a message saying that the patches for version 17.2.10 nuud be applyed on controller first, this mean a different process then the usual one? How should I proceed?
